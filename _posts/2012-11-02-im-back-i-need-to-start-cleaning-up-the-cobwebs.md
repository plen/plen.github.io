I need to start cleaning up the cobwebs here. But I’ll leave them for just one more day since it’s Halloween.

Since it’s a festival (of sorts), I will mark it with a recollection of a few personal milestones I’ve achieved in the months since my last post.

I stopped blogging for a time because I was due to leave 9flats, and I didn’t want to make it known till it was official. However, such a major event inevitably occupies your mind a lot, leaving me with little inclination to write about other things going on at the time. After it was done and dusted though (by Sept), I procrastinated a little more before sitting down today to do it.

In summary, here’s what’s happened to me since June.

### The Good
I’ve now joined a new startup called [Sent.ly](http://sent.ly/) responsible for customer acquisition / evangelism
I had a chance to fulfill a longstanding desire to work with former TenCube CEO / co-founder [Darius](https://twitter.com/rius).
I completed Ruby tutorials up until exercise 52 on [learncodethehardway](http://ruby.learncodethehardway.org/).
I started an interesting side project. It’s a free and public Startup Jobs board - [SGStartupJobs](http://bit.ly/startupjobs)
I attended FailCon / TechVenture 2012 and met some [very](https://twitter.com/AndriesDeVos) [interesting](https://twitter.com/bragiel) [people](https://twitter.com/lcseah).

### The Bad
I left Darius’ team when we discovered that I wasn’t a great fit for the team.
I left an excellent startup with an excellent team and excellent leaders in 9flats.
I stopped working on Ruby tutorials on learncodethehardway.
I didn’t manage to get any work done through meeting people at FailCon / TechVenture 2012.

### The Ugly
I discovered that I’m not cut out for software engineering. It reminds me of working on Economics problems in university. I could do them on threat of pain or death, but not for much less.
I’m still a broke entrepreneur.
Still ridden with student debt.
I might get to writing about any of the milestones above, but just to get blogging again I needed to list them down so I can strike them off my mental checklist of things to mention in my blog.

Overall it’s been an eventful few months, and I hope that I’ll get the time to write more about the notable parts, as well as keep writing about what’s going on at present as well.
