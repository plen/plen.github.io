title: Google Censoring Negative Hillary Clinton News
---
I was prompted today by my friend Eli to look into the viral video about Google [censoring negative Hillary Clinton results](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFxFRqNmXKg). After seeing the video by [Sourcefed](https://www.facebook.com/SourceFedNews/), I went right into it and discovered that not only is Google censoring it's results, Yahoo appears to be doing something similar, but only Microsoft's Bing seems immune to Hillary fever.

## Google Search in Singapore

Google had already filtered out negative news of Hillary Clinton in Singapore. This was no longer an American phenomenon. However, it remained to be seen if Bing and Yahoo offered unfiltered search results in Singapore as they did Stateside.

## Bing Search in Singapore

Bing apparently are immune to the forces that persuaded Google to censor their results. I didn't even have to tempt them with a leading "cr" for crimes or "ind" for indictment.

## Yahoo Search in Singapore

If you were hoping to see Hillary Clinton negative results on Yahoo, you're out of luck. Yahoo's censorship is so strangely aggressive that it doesn't even look like an algorithmic change. There are absolutely no suggested results for searches on Hillary Clinton with a leading "cr".

This holds true for leading "in"s as well. There were definitely some searches for "Hillary Clinton indiana" that I've seen floating around and in the video. But even this crumb is gone for Yahoo.

## Seeking Negativity

At this point, it's a fair question to wonder if there are any places left on Earth where Google will suggest negative Hillary Clinton news. I decided to give it a shot by circumventing Google's language settings altogether. I visited Google Malaysia and switched to Malay and also Google Taiwan in Traditonal Chinese. I then ran the original queries and see what turned up.

It seems that Google Malaysia didn't get the memo.

And neither did Google Taiwan.

## Conclusion

I eventually went on to run similar queries for Google Indonesia, Hong Kong and Ukraine, with identical results. Sourcefed's analysis is solid, and this is a scandal that could have far-reaching repercussions for Google.
