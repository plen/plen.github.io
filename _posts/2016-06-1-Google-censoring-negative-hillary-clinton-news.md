title: Google Censoring Negative Hillary Clinton News
---
I was prompted today by my friend Eli to look into the viral video about Google [censoring negative Hillary Clinton results](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFxFRqNmXKg). After seeing the video by [Sourcefed](https://www.facebook.com/SourceFedNews/), I went right into it and discovered that not only is Google censoring it's results, Yahoo appears to be doing something similar, but only Microsoft's Bing seems immune to Hillary fever.

## Google Search in Singapore

Google had already filtered out negative news of Hillary Clinton in Singapore. This was no longer an American phenomenon. However, it remained to be seen if Bing and Yahoo offered unfiltered search results in Singapore as they did Stateside.

Bing apparently are immune to the forces that persuaded Google to censor their results. I didn't even have to tempt them with a leading "cr" for crimes or "ind" for indictment.

## Yahoo Search in Singapore

If you were hoping to see Hillary Clinton negative results on Yahoo, you're out of luck. Yahoo's censorship is so strangely aggressive that it doesn't even look like an algorithmic change. There are absolutely no suggested results for searches on Hillary Clinton with a leading "cr".

This holds true for leading "in"s as well. There were definitely some searches for "Hillary Clinton indiana" that I've seen floating around and in the video. But even this crumb is gone for Yahoo.

## Seeking Negativity

At this point, it's a fair question to wonder if there are any places left on Earth where Google will suggest negative Hillary Clinton news. I decided to give it a shot by circumventing Google's language settings altogether. I visited Google Malaysia and switched to Malay and also Google Taiwan in Traditonal Chinese. I then ran the original queries and see what turned up.

It seems that Google Malaysia didn't get the memo.

And neither did Google Taiwan.

## Indonesia

Indonesia may genuinely be a place where Google could claim that "ind" shouldn't autofill "indictment". I switched over to Bahasa Indonesia and ran my by now standard query of "hillary clinton ind"

<img src ="/images/id-hillary-clinton-ind-id.png" alt="" class="img-rounded img-responsive">

<img src ="/images/id-hillary-clinton-indi-id.png" alt="" class="img-rounded img-responsive">

As expected Indonesia and Indiana were the top auto-fill results. This makes sense for Indonesia. I tried to take it further to see if I could tempt an indictment result out of Indonesia or if the filter had already happened.

As it turns out, Google Indonesia was more than willing to give me several suggestions, also strengthening the case that only English results were affected for now.

Just to be sure that these results weren't standard suggestions on Google.com, I ran the query again on Google with English chosen as my language.

That's 4 times less than what I can get from Google Indonesia.

## Hong Kong

The final place that I checked was Hong Kong. The results speak very clearly for themselves. My first set is for the leading snippet "cri", my second set further below are for "ind".

### Leading Cri with English language selected

### Leading Cr with Chinese language selected
<img src ="/images/hk-hillary-clinton-cr-cn.png" alt="" class="img-rounded img-responsive">

In the above, it's remarkable that when in Chinese, I need only "cr" to trigger a suggestion with "crime". 

### Leading Ind with English language selected

### Leading Cr with Chinese language selected

There is some oddness going on with "indigo" and "indian joke" as suggestions. I think that can be put down to users whose first language is Cantonese actually searching for those terms. And despite their fascination with colour and non-PC jokes, indictment is still a major topic.

## Conclusion

Sourcefed's analysis is solid, and this is a scandal that could have far-reaching repercussions for Google. The potential implications for politics the world over are massive, and this colours the legal disputes that Google has with governments all over the world a totally different shade. I'm sure there'll be a few chuckles at the Politburo of China's CCP in the coming days. I find this an ominous development, and look forward to a potential future where Google reverses it's decision to permit censorship in this way.
