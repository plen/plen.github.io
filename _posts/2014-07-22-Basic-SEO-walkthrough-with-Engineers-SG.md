title: "Basic SEO tips with Engineers SG"

Late last year I did a talk of basic SEO tips organized by the awesome [Michael Cheng](http://twitter.com/coderkungfu) and [Calvin Cheng](http://twitter.com/calvinchengx) (no relation). This was on 13 Dec 2013. It's been a long time since then but I thought it would be helpful to post the video here for all.
